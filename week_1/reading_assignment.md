# Reading assignment: Graphics Lies, Misleading Visuals

Cairo, A. (2015). Graphics lies, misleading visuals. In New Challenges for Data Design (pp. 103-116). Springer London.

## Introduction

* Lie factor = size of effect shown in the graphic / size of effect in data. 1.0 = accurate figure.
* Misleading vs. lying
    * Lie: Intentionally deceptive message
    * Mislead: Lead readers astray without the conscious intervention of the designer
    * Ethics: Must analyze the intention of the agent in order to determine whether it was "right" or "wrong." Many consider misleading to be ethically neutral.
* Consider the reader
    * Even when the author has innocently misled the reader, the reader still interprets the content as a sincere desire on the part of the author to inform.
    * The consequence of lying or misleading is, ultimately, the same. 
    
## Becoming a good liar

* Hiding relevant data to highlight what benefits us: Infographics often cherrypick data and have distracting illustrations
* Displaying too much dat to obscure reality
* Using graphic forms in inappropriate ways (distorting the data)

## The ignorance of evidence-based communicators

* Most journalists lack a basic bullshit detector and are not versed in basic science and statistics
* Many designers of visualization yield to aesthetic preferences instead of striving for accuracy
